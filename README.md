# Turmerik
Turmerik is meant to become an app suite that will include a lightweight file system explorer, cloud storage explorer for authenticated users, along with docs editing and markdown support (along side cloud storage platform's native docs editing, like Google Docs and Ms Word Online, but not modifying those directly). 

That would mainly be usefull for creating highly customizable docs and notes in ways that are not currently offered by the platform's native editors, much like stackedit, but with added flexibility and native apps, not just a web app (like stackedit only currently offers) and full support for customizable keyboard shortcuts.

In addition, it's also intended to offer some software development aiding features like Visual Studio Code extensions for code refactoring and consistency, along with operating system customizations for devices they would be installed on.
